Project Plan: An automation tool will be created by Jacob Guzman using PyCharm IDE and the Python programming language.  This school will highlight some of the topics in National Universityâ€™s CYB 333 Security Automation course.  Over thirty students were prompted to provide recommendations for cybersecurity automation scripts that ranged from Security Tools, Open-Source Intelligence Tools,  Network Traffic Analysis or Incident Response, and Cloud Security Automation.  The most popular discussed Python scripts from each of the four topics in the course will be selected and implemented into the tool.  The tool will allow a user to select one of the core topics and then have the option to select from five tools pertaining to that selection.  Once a final selection is made, a web browser will open with a direct link to the page of that tool.
